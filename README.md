🌐In an effort to address the prevalent mental health challenges such as stress and anxiety, our team has developed an innovative project at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Music. Introducing an Emotion-Based Music Player powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML).

*Objective:*
The primary goal of this project is to leverage the therapeutic benefits of music to aid individuals dealing with mental health issues. Through advanced emotion recognition algorithms, the AIML music player dynamically curates playlists on YouTube tailored to the user's emotional state, creating a personalized and healing musical experience.

*Key Features:*
1. *Emotion Recognition:🙂*
   - Utilizing state-of-the-art emotion detection algorithms to analyze user sentiment in real-time.
   - Dynamically adjusts the music playlist based on the detected emotional state to provide a comforting and uplifting listening experience.

2. *User Input Flexibility:💻*
   - Enhancing versatility, users can input their preferred singer and language to further personalize their music recommendations.
   - A seamless integration with popular platforms like YouTube ensures a vast and diverse selection of music from around the world.


*How It Works:*
1. *Emotion Analysis:👨🏻‍💻*
   - The AI analyzes facial expressions, to determine the user's emotional state ,We compare User Facial expression to pre-trained model (We are using ANN model to train data) to determine the Emotion of user.
  
2. *Personalization:*
   - Users can input their preferred singer and language, allowing the AIML music player to fine-tune recommendations based on individual tastes.
   - The personalized playlists cater to the user's cultural preferences and linguistic comfort.

*Impact:🌎*
With mental health at the forefront of our concerns, this project aims to make a meaningful impact by harnessing the power of technology and music to provide solace and support to individuals facing emotional challenges.
